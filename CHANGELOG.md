# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. The protocol version (ECP) and the engine version are tracked separately.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-03

First public draft. Engine milestone M1; protocol ECP `2026-11-01` (draft).

### Added

- Design document and ECP v0 specification, with the normative schema in `spec/schema.ts`.
- `engram` engine in Go: MCP server over stdio with `observe`, `recall`, `get` and `forget` tools (the ECP MCP compatibility profile).
- SQLite store with namespaces, provenance, bitemporal validity (`supersedes`, `as_of`), forget with cascade and an audit log.
- Client pairing through the CLI (`pair`, `clients`, `revoke`) with per-namespace read and write grants and optional expiry.
- Secret filter that refuses keys, tokens, private keys and payment card numbers.
- BM25 ranking for recall (replaced by embeddings in M2).
